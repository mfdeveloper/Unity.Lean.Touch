## Welcome to Lean!

> **PS:** This repo is only a mirror to original asset store package, without any features modifications. See [Asset Store Lean Touch](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/lean-touch-30111)

The documentation for all Lean assets is inside the root of each directory.

For example, for Lean Touch you can find it in: [Editor/DOCUMENTATION.asset](Editor/DOCUMENTATION.asset).

To open it, simply select it in the editor and click the **"Local Documentation"** button!

You can also open the documentation by clicking the **"Documentation"** icon at the top right of any Lean component.

Enjoy!
